Web development is an adventure, but debugging? That’s the boss level none of us signed up for. Like any monumental challenge, debugging is a journey filled with emotional stages. If you’ve ever stared at a rogue semicolon like it personally insulted you, you’ll relate. Let’s explore the seven stages of debugging grief.

---

### **1. Shock and Denial**
*“But it worked on my machine!”*

You run your code confidently, only to see the console light up with errors. Surely, this must be a typo in the error message generator, not your brilliant masterpiece.

---

### **2. Pain and Guilt**
*“I’m a terrible developer. My cat could write better code.”*

The imposter syndrome kicks in, and you begin questioning every life choice that brought you here. You apologize to the rubber duck debugging companion for your incompetence. 

---

### **3. Anger and Bargaining**
*“Who wrote this garbage? Oh wait… it was me.”*

Angrily muttering under your breath, you begin rewriting entire functions, deleting comments, and adding others. Bargaining starts: *“If I just fix this bug, I swear I’ll comment my code forever.”* Spoiler alert: you won’t.

---

### **4. Depression**
*“I’m doomed. This bug will outlive me.”*

By now, you’ve read 17 Stack Overflow threads, none of which help. The only suggestion that works starts with *“Have you tried rewriting your app in Python?”* You spiral, contemplating a simpler life—perhaps as a goat farmer.

---

### **5. The Upward Turn**
*“Wait… could it really be that simple?”*

After hours of flailing, you stumble on a hint: maybe it’s the wrong API key? A missing semicolon? An angry curly brace? Suddenly, hope flickers.

---

### **6. Reconstruction and Working It Out**
*“Yes! I’m a genius! Bow down to my superior debugging skills!”*

You fix the bug. You’re a superhero. It’s all hugs, high-fives, and a celebratory trip to the vending machine. The console is clean. Life is good.

---

### **7. Acceptance and Hope**
*“Well, it works now, so… ship it!”*

This stage is brief because the next bug inevitably emerges. You’ve learned nothing, but hey, that’s web development: an endless loop of bugs, fixes, and caffeine.

---

**Conclusion**  
Debugging is less about perfection and more about perseverance (and coffee). So the next time your app throws an error, remember: you’re not alone. The *real* bug is the friends we made along the way. Or something.
